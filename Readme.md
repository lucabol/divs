# Cross reference M* and SimpleSafeDividends criterias

Gets list of stocks from Download folder as exported from M* and SSD, massage the data and table/chart it.

Requires qsv, csvkit and gnuplot ...

Without modification, this is just useful to me as it requires the screens of SSD and M* to be set so as to have the field expected in the code.

1. Download the result of the screens on the two sites (M* downloads an excel file??)
2. Do `run build` or `Taskfile build`, the `run table` and `run chart`
